<p>Ok, so the world did not end. Everyone gets another chance to start a new, better, life. That deep spiritual experience has changed me, and showed me new path. So here we are, on my own, new site.<br />
I've done my part in the kitchen for Christmas Eve, and head to PC to clean up this place a bit.</p>
<p>You can find now only two categories, all other meta informations will be in Tags. I'll also will try (again ;)) to try more frequently.<br />
Second change is that I'll be trying to write only in English here. Polish category is for older posts + I'll be linking to DC blog, were I intend to start blogging also.</p>
<p>So let's see how it goes. :)</p>
