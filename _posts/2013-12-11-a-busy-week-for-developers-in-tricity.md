<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>long time no see. I'm still struggling what I want to blog about, as this year changed a lot. Most likely I'll start from those changes, but I need some time for that :E As for now, let me run a short update about what's happening in Tricity.</p>
<p>First of all, tomorrow we've got 50th TricityJUG meeting :D Hell yeah! So if you want to learn something about GWT from someone who worked with it for about 2 years, then you should definitely be on the meeting tomorrow! Check out news on <a title="Tricity JUG meeting GWT" href="http://trojmiasto.jug.pl/2013/12/04/50th-meeting-rafal-rybacki/">JUG site</a>.</p>
<p>Second thing you should look forward to is a <a title="Global day of code retreat hosted by TJUG" href="http://trojmiasto.jug.pl/2013/12/08/global-day-of-code-retreat-14-12-2013/">Global Day of Code Retreat in Tricity</a>. This year finally we'll host it in Gdańsk :D I was waiting for that for years, and it finally happens ! I'm super excited about it. I'll miss the chance to pair up with people, as I'm on organizing side. Still I'm super fired that TJUG is going to enable a big group of devs an opportunity to take a part in that event :) More good news: we still got <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/global-day-of-coderetreat-gdansk-tickets-9500988713">some tickets left</a>. Event is free. Food, passionate geeks and code deletion are taken for granted. If you're in Tricity this Saturday then join us now.</p>
<p>Finally last, but not least. This Saturday there is career expo: <a title="career expo tricity" href="http://careercon.pl/">careercon.pl</a> If you're a software professional looking for job opportunities then you should check it out. It's a great chance to catch up with what's happening in Tricity. Also there will be 2 conference tracks full of tech stuff, including my talk about what's new in JDK 8. As time slots are rather short, you can treat that as a prelude to what will  be happening on TJUG starting from Feb till end of the year ;)</p>
<p>And yeah, to give that talk, I'll have to skip on Code Retreat lunch, which is provided by the <a href="http://www.restauracjaset.pl/">Set Restaurant</a> :(</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finger crossed for the blog. If all goes well, then this time I'm bringing it up for good (a.k.a. I won't be so lazy this time)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
