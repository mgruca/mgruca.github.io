<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I just finished uploading some of photographs I taken on 33degree conference to my flickr account.</p>
<p>To see all of them follow <a title="All of my 33degree photos" href="http://goo.gl/A8s1F" target="_blank">this</a> link. Click those link for photos from <a title="Day 1 only from 33degree, photo set" href="http://goo.gl/hinPh" target="_blank">day 1</a>, Â <a title="Day 2 only from 33degree, photo set" href="http://goo.gl/80BOk" target="_blank">day 2</a>, <a href="http://goo.gl/5VqhB" target="_blank">day 3</a> only.</p>
<p>I won't upload everything I have taken on conference, but I will send them to Grzegorz. He will get them in original size (and that means hell big :)) and maybe will decide to share more of them or same but not resized.</p>
<p>As per reusing and license. I share them under <a title="CC-BY license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" target="_blank">CC -BY license</a>. Note however that if you want to use them commercially (yeah, right :D), you probably should ask person on photo for permission.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you are on one of photos and don't want it to be published then notice me, I will either remove photo or censor it :)</p>
<p>Oh and don't get used to English on my blog. I'll be still posting mainly in Polish.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER</p>
<p>I know that some of the photos are moved, too dark or just crappy as hell. I hate to use flash, as I consider it distracting and rude, so I tried to use only light that was in the room. There wasn't much of it there. I did my best, but those were my first steps with new camera and I still need to improve my technique. Next year batch will be better :)</p>
