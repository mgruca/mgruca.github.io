<p>Some time ago, on Warsaw Java User Group, I read a note from presentation about idea of Jakub Nabrdalik. From what  I understood, Jakub proposed to create just one public class in each package. I like the idea, and as I still love Tapestry 5 (even more after working with it for half a year and getting back to Spring now), I combined the two. But we'll get back to that later.</p>
<p>The main reason why I like that technique, is that from architecture perspective it's just leveraging idea of encapsulation.</p>
<p>My idea regards topic discussed one of the thing with my own way and the result reminded me about <a title="Igor Drobiazko - Tapestry IOC vs OSGI" href="http://blog.tapestry5.de/index.php/2010/01/19/tapestry-ioc-modularization-of-web-applications-without-osgi/">old article by Igor Drobiazko</a>, which always inspired me and took whole thing to another level.<br />
In my opinion That's simplest way to build highly modular and plugable applications.<br />
From architectural point of view, it's the easiest way to leverage encapsulation to a higher level. It's easier to hide package scope classes and other implementation details. It's easy to control which modules can use out utilities/frameworks. It's easier to test without leaking implementation to all collaborators.<br />
The one public class becomes facade fit whole module. We encapsulate details of business process in set of package classes. And in case that some functionality is system wide needed we can easily refector by increasing visibility and building new module.<br />
what worth noticing is that such module after adding an interface may be just one of implementations our a plugin.<br />
During discussion someone asked how to build such modules (reduced visibility affects possible ways in which we can build the class), and I had an idea which lead me to this while post.<br />
In going to show building those modules using Tapestry IOC. That may be possible to do in other way but with usage of second mechanism we'll get highly plugable architecture.</p>
<p>One thing with mentioning it's that Tapestry scans class path at the start in search for sub modules. This way we don't have to do anything and we get OSGI like mechanism for free.<br />
Using that in our favor we may build instantly systems for different clients. No more branching per client needed, no more if/switches or hacking couple of min before release. Clean and simple build with various pom/gradle files for a client or a global configuration panel. We could extend it even more and use Tapestry ability to build highly dynamic pages and build navigation menus and show functionalities based on provided components and services.</p>
