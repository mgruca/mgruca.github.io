<p>Bit late, but  I could not help much about it. 33degree was great, as usual not much to add. 3 days of Rock Star Speakers with topnotch talks and no one can argue about that :) There were already enough post written about it, so I'm simply going to skip that part ;) The only thing that I'm going to say about quality of conference is that I'm going to vote with my wallet and register for next year edition.</p>
<p>But to the point. Main reason why I write this post is to share experience from Open Data Hackathon.</p>
<p>When? Who? Where?</p>
<p>Tuesday evening, day before the conference started, <a title="Kuba Marchwicki Twitter stream" href="https://twitter.com/kubem" target="_blank">Kuba Marchwicki</a> with <a href="http://epf.org.pl/" target="_blank">Fundacja ePaństwo</a> (eGoverment Foundation) and thanks to the 33degree organizers (Thanks Grzegorz), gave as access to room Agat (+ a stash of beer ^^).</p>
<p>We started on Tuesday and were working till the last day of conference. After last keynote we've been given time on a main stage to present results of our work.</p>
<p>But what you've guys been doing?</p>
<p>Fundacja ePaństwo gave us a walk through the API, available data, explained what they do and why we should care. After that introduction we had a huge brainstorm to decided what we'll be doing in the course of the next 3 days, and decided that from all ideas, the best one is to provide neat web application that will allow digitalization declarations of assets (pl. Oświadczenia majątkowe) of Polish representatives. For international readers: in Poland members of parliament, government, and noteworthy people related to public domain (I just don't know who exactly :P) have to fill a form, where they state what assets (cash, houses, cars, etc) they got.</p>
<p>Who? // internaltional team</p>
<p>Why? //why we did that, why they do that</p>
<p>How it went?</p>
<p>//Touk was fun</p>
