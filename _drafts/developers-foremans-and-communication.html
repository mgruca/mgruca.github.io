<p>As I'm in a middle of a big shift in my life I had no time to comment on that topic before. Better for me. I had a chance to see a end to a storm that once again Uncle Bob started. This post is sponsored by <strong>Uncle Bob</strong> number <strong>3</strong> and letter C as <strong>Communication</strong> and <strong>Context</strong></p>
<p>Recently Uncle Bob posted 3 articles on why IT projects should have Foremans "<a title="Where is The Foreman - Uncle Bob on 8th Light Blog " href="http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2014/02/21/WhereIsTheForeman.html">Where is the Foreman</a>?" [1], "<a title="Oh Foreman where art thou ? - Uncle Bob on 8th Light blog" href="http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2014/02/23/OhForemanWhereArtThou.html">Oh Foreman, Where art Thou?</a>"[2], "<a title="A spectrum of trust - Uncle Bob on 8th Light blog" href="http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2014/02/27/TheTrustSpectrum.html">A spectrum of trust</a>"[3]. It's a good read, so you may dive into it right now, although I'll try to sum it up as I'm not trying to debate on Foreman idea. I'll focus only on communication aspect.</p>
<h3>Quick summary of Martin post</h3>
<p>Uncle Bob proposed that every commit should be checked by one person with commit rights and only that one person should commit all changes to main repo. Role of that person is to ensure, that code is tested, comments are updated, standards are kept, refactoring has happened. That made couple people quite angry. Why? Anyone heard about Bob the Merger role? So Another post had to be written, with sad story about developer wife that had cancer what resulted in lowered quality of code and coverage which lead to firing poor developer. Sad as hell, but it haven't melted hearts of people disagreeing with Uncle Bob. So he wrote third post in which he explained what the real issue is.</p>
<p>Third post is about trust. In OpenSource projects you don't trust everyone. Trust has to be gained. And that is good. No discussion. When new people join your team, you should control what they are doing. Uncle Bob simply proposed one way of doing that, the best in his opinion. I don't expect part 4 of series, as I guess everyone are on the same page now. We may start</p>
<h3>To the point</h3>
<p>So why it had to take 3 blog posts and billion of responses (just check <a title="Responses to Uncle Bob Post" href="https://www.google.pl/search?q=foreman+uncle+bob">google</a>) to make simple statement that should be quite obvious? If you think it's a one timer, then let me remind about Uncle Bob statement, that he always has 100% coverage in code and anything else is not professional. It took me some time to find disclaimer that DB, UI and bean properties are excluded. Because Uncle Bob assumed that we all are on the same page, and what he wrote should be clear for everyone he had to re-do his work several times.</p>
<p>"Well, and how it affects me?" you may ask. It's dead simple, my observation is that many people in IT has serious issues with communication and that is source of many issues. Have you ever done something more than once, just because someone understood it in different way than you did? For example have you ever clarified your blog post with next two because no one agreed with you?</p>
<p><strong>I'm not bashing on Uncle Bob</strong>, don't get me wrong! He's a icon for may of us, so he makes a great example to show how important context is. He's also good at communicating so I hope we can learn from this something not so obvious.</p>
<p>If you explain something, and you see that people just don't get it, before you start repeating same thing again, just louder, please back off for a second. Take a deep breath and think what both parties can see in other way. If you can't try to explain context of the issue (eg. 100% coverage of business logic, which does not include DB and UI or Foreman just for newcomers). In most cases, such simple act, should help all parties to find the common ground. If you want to see that in live version please go through all 3 Martin blog posts. He has been adding more and more context each time, and replaced one example with other till everything was clear.</p>
<p>He could shout at people that they are stupid and simply don't understand his greatness, instead he patiently come from very different angle each time to explain what issue is he solving. By setting context in which his case is valid, he convinced people (me for sure). If you shout and swear (not that any reasonable developer would be shouting or swearing ...) then people will stop talking with you, and as much it may sound tempting to you, trust me that it's not a good long time strategy.</p>
